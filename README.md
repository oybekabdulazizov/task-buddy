# TaskBuddy

Gotta give the credit. What can I say? 

Thanks to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/), you can get a dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules (e.g. extremely fast Hot Module Replacement).  


## Demo 

Thanks to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), you can see the deployed app [here](https://task-buddy-oybek.vercel.app/).

But first, I suggest reading the below description quickly. 


## Description

A simple todo app with a slick and responsive UI that can help you get organized with your day and time. 
Simply [open the app](https://task-buddy-oybek.vercel.app/) and you will know what to do. 

In this project, I mainly focused on reusable components, folder structure, testing the reusable components using Jest and React Testing Library, and proper component creation. 


## Tech stack 

- React.JS 
- Typescript 
- Redux/Toolkit
- Tailwind CSS 
- Jest + React Testing Library
